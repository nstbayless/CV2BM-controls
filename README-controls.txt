# Improved Controls for Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge (Gameboy)

*By NaOH*

## Functionality

This hack adjusts Christopher Belmont's control scheme to be more like Mega Man or Symphony of the Night.

- Belmont can now turn around and stop in mid-air.
- Belmont regains control during knockback.
- (`vcancel` patches only!) When the jump button is released, Belmont immediately starts falling again; this allows the player to make smaller hops if desired.
- (`inertia` patches only!) When adjusting velocity in mid-air, Belmont only accelerates slowly (rather than changing direction instantaneously).

Additionally, a `vcancel-only` patch is provided which makes only the `vcancel` change and no other change.

If you are unsure which patch you would like, the recommended hack is `inertia-vcancel.ips`.
    
## Patching Instructions

There are patches for each combination of rom (US/EU; JP; EU Konami GB Vol. 4) and for parameters selected (see "Functionality" above). Only one patch should be used.
Please note that the US and EU roms are the same. You may wish to verify your rom before patching by checking a hash (see "ROM HASHES" below).

Patch using FLIPS or any other IPS patcher. Please note that gameboy roms contain an internal checksum -- this
patch does not modify the checksum, but if you so desire you may wish to correct the checksum using a utilitiy such as rgbfix.
In any case, this is purely cosmetic because a real gameboy does not actually verify the checksum.

## Compatability with other hacks

Should be compatible with the speed hack: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/213/ (apply the speed hack first.)

Also compatible with the subweapons hack: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7641/
